      "description": "The caps are 5–12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) wide, white, sometimes with a grayish-tan center, dry, and either unchanged or yellowing slightly when bruised. The stalk is 3–10 cm (1.2–3.9 in) long and 1–2 wide, perhaps larger at the base. It has a persistent ring. The spores are brown and smooth. The species, like many members of Agaricus section Xanthodermati, displays a yellowing (then darker) reaction where its flesh has been damaged, although this is not always readily apparent. The cap surface turns yellow in KOH"

      "introduction": "Agaricus hondensis, commonly known as the felt-ringed agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. The species was officially described in 1912 by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill, along with three other Agaricus species that have since been placed in synonymy with A. hondensis.",
      "description": "The fungus produces fruit bodies (mushrooms) with white to gray-brown caps up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter covered with pale pinkish-brown scales that darken in age. The tightly-packed gills on the cap underside are initially white before becoming pinkish, lilac-gray, and finally brownish as the spores mature. The stout stipe is bulbous and has a thick, white, felt-like ring. The mushroom has an unpleasant odor similar to phenol or creosote, and develops a soapy-metallic taste when cooked. It can be distinguished from similar Agaricus species by differences in geographic range, habitat, staining reaction, and odor. Found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, A. hondensis fruits in the fall under conifers or in mixed forests. The mushroom is poisonous, causing severe gastrointestinal upset if consumed."

It is 5 to 9 centimetres (2 to 3+1⁄2 in) in diameter, and yellows when bruised. It is ovate when young, flattening later. The stem has a drooping ring and stains yellow very easily when bruised, this colour then changes to brown over time. The stem flesh bruises yellow only faintly and is more noticeable in the base. The gills are crowded and free, as is typical for an Agaricus. They are pink on young specimens, but brown to black on older fruit bodies. The flesh is white and does not change colour on cutting. It smells like ink, iodoform, phenol, sweat, or mouldy straw. The spores are 4–6 x 3–4 μm and are elliptical."

This species is found in grassy areas, often near wood debris (especially next to pines and populus), indicating its preference for nutrient-rich substrates. It thrives in temperate climates and is most commonly seen during the rainier seasons. The mushroom can be found in diverse habitats and conditions, particularly prevalent during warmer climates. Consuming agaricus phaeolepidotus can lead to serious health risks, including gastrointestinal distress, vertigo, vision problems, and issues with blood circulation. Despite its unique morphology, caution is advised as it can be mistaken for non-toxic species."

      "description": "Agaricus placomyces has a cap that is 5–13 centimetres (2–5 in) wide and varies from convex to broadly convex or nearly flat in age. In addition, the surface of the cap is dry and covered with brownish fibers and scales, especially over the center. Underneath, the cap can be whitish under normal environments, or pinkish in wet weather. Covered with fine, appressed greyish-brown scales and concentrated at the disc, the cap is thick, slowly becoming vinaceous when injured; the odor smells of phenol. The flesh is white, and become yellow when placed in KOH. The gills of this mushroom are free from the stem, crowded, and pale grayish-pink, turning brown in age. In addition, the stem is 6–15 cm long, 1–1.5 cm. thick and more or less equal, with an enlarged base (unlike typically ending in a small bulb like Agaricus pocillator). Also, it is fairly smooth, white and bruising yellow, especially at the base, with a persistent ring, and the partial veil when still covering the gills developing brownish to yellowish droplets. At 8–15 cm long and 2–3.5 cm thick, the stipe is slightly enlarged at the base; the surface is white, and smooth above and below the ring. The veil of the stipe is membranous, thick, white, and forms a persistent ring with a smooth upper and lower surface. The base of the stipe is typically yellow when bruised and smells of phenol."

It displays a strong yellow colouration at the base of the stem when cut. It has a phenolic smell. It is poisonous for most people, causing gastric upset, but can be eaten by some without apparent negative effect.",
      "description": "The cap ranges from 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter. It is initially convex, with some young specimens having a squarish shape, though flattening with age. It is whitish with light brown tints towards the centre. The cap is dry and smooth, but can be scaly when old. The gills of this mushroom progress from pale-pink to a chocolate color. Its white stipe measures 5–12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) tall and 1–3 wide, and is bulbous with a skirt-like ring. Microscopically, the cheilocystidia are club-shaped. The spores are brown, elliptical, and smooth, measuring 6–7 × 3–4 μm. The species has an unpleasant characteristic smell, which is phenolic, reminiscent of ink or carbolic soap. The smell is especially strong at the base of the stem. On cooking, the smell becomes very noticeable, and this may deter people from eating it inadvertently. The main identifying feature is an immediate bright yellow colouration on cutting through the base of the stem, or scraping the flesh; later, the affected area fades to a dull brown. Numerous edible Agaricus species, such as A. augustus, A arvensis and A. silvicola, turn yellow to a greater or lesser extent, but they do not display such an intense reaction. Agaricus xanthodermus belongs to a group of related species (the \"Xanthodermati\") which likewise discolour bright yellow and have a phenolic smell. They include A. praeclaresquamosus (formerly A. placomyces) which has dark grey scales, A. moelleri and A. pilatianus, which does not have a bulbous stem."

Named for the characteristic shape of its fruit bodies, this white Amanita has a slender stem, a cap covered with conical white warts, and an \"abruptly enlarged\" swollen base. This terrestrial species grows in mixed woods in eastern North America and eastern Asia, where it is thought to exist in a mycorrhizal relationship with a variety of both coniferous and deciduous tree species.",
      "description": "As with most mushrooms, the bulk of A. abrupta lies beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of 4 to 10 centimeters (1+1⁄2 to 4 inches), and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2 mm tall by 1–2 mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it. The stem is 6.5 to 12.5 cm (2+1⁄2 to 5 in) tall, and slender, with a diameter of 0.5 to 1.5 cm (1⁄4 to 1⁄2 in). It is white, smooth (glabrous), solid (that is, not hollow internally), and has an abruptly bulbous base with the shape of a flattened sphere; it may develop longitudinal splits on the sides. The base is often attached to a copious white mycelium—a visual reminder that the bulk of the organism lies unseen below the surface. The ring is membranous, and persistent—not weathering away with time; the ring may be attached to the stem with white fibers. The mushroom has no distinct odor."

The center of the cap is gray to brown with a gray edge. The white gills are closely crowded together and free from attachment to the stipe. In young mushrooms, the gills exude drops of clear fluid. The dry, white to pale grey stipe measures 8–20 cm (3–8 in) long by 0.5–1.7 cm (1⁄4–3⁄4 in) thick. It has a bulbous base, a white to grey, membranous volva at the stipe base, and white mycelium at the base. The stipe has a white ring. The odor of the flesh is mild to unpleasant. The spore print is white. Spores are smooth, amyloid, spherical or roughly so, and measure 7–10 by 6.8–9.5 μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae. Amanita vaginata is similar, however A. vaginata has non-amyloid spores and lacks a ring on the stipe. It differs from A. phalloides (the death cap) in the colour of its cap."
